The potPin variable represents the analog pin (A0) to which the potentiometer is connected. This pin will read the voltage value from the potentiometer.

Inside the loop() function, we use analogRead(potPin) to read the voltage value from the potentiometer. This value is then mapped using the map() function to convert the range 0-1023 to a fade speed range of 1-10.

The fadeSpeed variable stores the mapped value, representing the fade speed for the LEDs. This value is used in the fading loops to control the speed of the fade.

Each LED is faded in and out using the specified fadeSpeed. The brightness is adjusted gradually using the analogWrite() function with PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

The delay(30) statement controls the speed of the fade effect by adding a delay of 30 milliseconds between each change in brightness. You can adjust this value to modify the speed of the fade effect according to your preference.

By incorporating a potentiometer, you can now control the fade speed of the LEDs manually. Adjusting the potentiometer knob will change the voltage value read by the Arduino, which in turn adjusts the fade speed of the LEDs in real-time.

Remember to connect the potentiometer to the correct pin (A0 in this example) and adjust the pin assignments (ledPins) if necessary.

Feel free to further customize the code and add more functionality to create your desired LED effects!
