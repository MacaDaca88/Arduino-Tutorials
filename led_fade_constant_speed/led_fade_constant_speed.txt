The setup() function is called once when the Arduino board starts. It is used to initialize the board and set up any necessary configurations. Here, we use the pinMode() function to set the LED pin (in this case, pin 9) as an output pin.

The loop() function is where the main code execution takes place. It runs repeatedly after the setup() function finishes executing. Inside the loop() function, we have the following steps:

The first for loop is responsible for fading the LED in. It starts with a brightness value of 0 and increases it by the fadeSpeed amount (here, 5) on each iteration. The analogWrite() function is used to set the LED brightness using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which allows for smooth intensity control. The delay() function is used to control the speed of the fade by adding a small delay (30 milliseconds) between each brightness change.

After the LED reaches its maximum brightness (255), the second for loop is executed to fade the LED out. Similar to the first loop, it starts with a brightness value of 255 and decreases it by the fadeSpeed amount on each iteration. The LED brightness is again set using analogWrite() and a delay is added to control the speed of the fade.

By repeating the fading in and fading out process in a continuous loop, the code creates a fading effect for the LED. You can adjust the fadeSpeed value to control the speed of the fade, and modify the delays to change the fade duration.

Make sure to connect the LED to the correct pin (pin 9 in this example) and adjust the pin assignment (ledPin) if necessary.

Feel free to experiment with this code and customize it to achieve different fading patterns or effects!
