The ledPins array stores the pin assignments for the LEDs. In this case, we have added 5 additional LEDs connected to pins 10, 11, 12, and 13.

The ledColors array stores the names of the colors for each LED. We have named them "Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow", and "Cyan".

The fadeSpeeds array stores the randomly generated fade speeds for each LED. We generate a random fade speed between 1 and 9 for each LED.

Inside the setup() function, we use a for loop to set each LED pin as an output pin using pinMode().

Inside the loop() function, we use another for loop to iterate through each LED. For each LED, we generate a random fade speed and perform the fading effect.

The fading process remains the same as before, with the LED brightness being set using analogWrite() and delays being added to control the speed of the fade.

By incorporating 5 additional LEDs with different colors, the code allows for simultaneous fading of multiple LEDs, each with its own random fade speed.

Make sure to connect the LEDs to the correct pins (10, 11, 12, and 13 in this example) and adjust the pin assignments (ledPins) and color names (ledColors) if necessary.

Feel free to experiment with this code and customize it further to achieve different effects or incorporate more LEDs and colors!
